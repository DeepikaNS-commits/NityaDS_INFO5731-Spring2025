
### **NLP Task**:

Sentiment Analysis: The primary NLP task for this dataset that we will perform is sentiment analysis. This involves classifying each text entry based on its sentimentâ€”positive, negative, or neutral.
### Labeling Schema:

- Positive: Text entries that express satisfaction, praise, or positivity.
- Negative: Text entries that express dissatisfaction, criticism, or negativity.
- Neutral: Text entries that are balanced, indifferent, or neither positive nor negative.
### Process:

1. Data Collection:

- Use your own reviews or tweets dataset that you have in your `.xlsx` file.
2. Data Annotation:
Manual Annotation:
- Carefully read each review or tweet and annotate it manually by adding a sentiment tag: positive, negative, or neutral.
Column Names:
- Add a new column called `sentiment` in your data file where you will store these tags.
3. Example CSV Structure

Here is an example of how your data file might look after annotation:
   ```
   document_id,created_at,text,sentiment

   2,2025-02-20 04:05:50,"Playing around with AI. #Catwoman #Riddler #AI #gothamcity",neutral

positive
```    
4. Labeling Schema Explanation:

- Positive: Text entries exhibiting positive emotions, i.e., enthusiasm, approval, or happiness. Example: "I love this product!"
- Negative: Text inputs bearing negative feelings, such as disappointment, criticism, or dissatisfaction. Example: "This is the worst service I've ever had."
   - Neutral: Text inputs that are neutral, neither possessing highly strong positive nor negative feelings. Example: "The event was okay, nothing special."
### NLP Task:

For assignment four, you are doing **Sentiment Analysis**. This is to classify the text entries into three categories of sentiment: positive, negative, or neutral. You can also do these other NLP tasks:
- Named Entity Recognition (NER): Extract and classify proper nouns and named entities from the text.

- Summarization: Develop a concise summary of the text entries.
- Text Classification: Classify text entries into pre-defined categories of content.
Steps to be taken:

1. Data Preparation:
   Manually annotate your data with sentiments and store the data in the form of a CSV file.
2. GitHub Upload: Push the annotated CSV file into your GitHub repository.
3. Documentation: Labeling schema documentation and description of all the sentiment labels in brief.
With these steps, you will be left with an properly annotated dataset to perform sentiment analysis as well as other NLP tasks as and when required for your assignment.
